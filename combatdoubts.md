# Combating Doubts
There is one incredibly common question that is asked incredibly often in plural spaces:

> “What if I’m faking?”

Here is the thing:
**You can't fake on accident.** Faking requires intentional, deliberate intention to pretend to experience something you otherwise do not. Otherwise it’s not faking. You can be mistaken, but you cannot fake.

If you feel like you could be mistaken, *what things would you otherwise be able to comfortably explain your experiences with*?

**You are not taking any kind of finite resource to identify as plural or read plural resources.** If you got a dissociative specialty therapist and are going to therapy, then you probably do need that help. It’s not a waste to help you. Its not a waste to identify in a way that makes you happier.

**IF THE FRAMEWORK HELPS YOU THEN USE IT**

**Denial is extremely common even in those who have been professionally diagnosed for years.** Pretty much everyone doubts themselves from time to time, even systems who are fully out and have been in the community for years.
That's not even getting into how a major feature of dissociation is making one doubt their experiences are real as a defense mechanism.
Having bouts of denial shouldn’t be used as an indication of one's validity.

If you are having trouble fighting doubts about your experiences, one of the best ways to do this is to **write down your experiences** so you can look at them as evidence later. It can often be very hard in the moment to think of your experiences, and something that lays down the material experiences that have been happening can really help with that. This is another way system journals can be useful, as you have a longstanding documentation of experience to refer to.

## "Is It Valid If...?"

There is a very common category of question that is similar;

'is it normal/common/possible/ok if...?'
And then a detailing of a reported experience the person has.

The 'cute' response to the normal question is that plurality in general is something out of the societal norm, so no given experience is going to be 'normal', **take pride in being abnormal**! And so we make windchimes out of the bottles thrown at us, and all that.

Its not however, usually the question people are *really* asking when they say that- like all the other variations listed, its usually a really asking if they are *allowed* to be experiencing whatever it is they are experiencing while being plural.

The usual answer to these kinds of questions is yes, a material experience can happen because your system is experiencing it.
That is the proof right there.

One of the best things you can do for yourself around doubts is to learn how to get your own validation internally and not rely on others giving you permission to experience something you are experiencing regardless.

As before- **You cannot fake by accident**.

Because plural experiences are incredibly varied, its also quite likely that these experiences are shared by other systems.

To get some of the most commonly asked things out of the way and emphasized- it is fully possible to be plural and:
- Have any other mental illness or developmental disorder
- Have any origin belief under the sun
- Have religious or spiritual/metaphysical practices that intersect with your plurality
- Have your plural experiences only start in adulthood
- Have been fully seperate people 'since birth'
- Have a high stress/intensive job while being plural
- Get a degree in college while plural
- Have no conflict or lots of conflict in your system
- Have system members split off later in life
- Have your plural experiences change over time
- Have a system that is mostly/entirely fictives, factives, and/or nonhumans
- Have a system that is very large or very small
- Not have amnesia
- Not ever switch
- Not have an inner world
- Not communicate well/at all
- Not remember any trauma
- Not have mixed dissociative experiences alongside the plurality
- Be an immersive/maladaptive daydreamer of any kind and plural
- Be sexually active while plural
- Be able to switch at will
- Be able to communicate very well
- Be able to recall all trauma the system has faced
- To only have members 'just show up' rather than split off
- To get a sudden influx of a large number of headmates at once for whatever reason
- To have some or all of your headmates going quiet/dormant for awhile (days, weeks, months, sometimes years)

Your experiences are FINE, promise.
