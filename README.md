# Dragon's Plural Survival Guide

> This site is made with [Docsify](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/)!

## What is this?
This is a guide about the topic of plurality, and is currently a work in progress!

## How to Use This Guide
Plurality can be a super tricky topic, and its even trickier to manage.
This becomes even moreso when one does not have access to a useful and understanding therapist or when one does not perfectly fit the medical model and ideas and treatment under it.

This is a guide that is intended to fill that gap and be a community-self-help resource.

The curators of this guide have noticed that many newbies have a hard time rooting around for good plural-related information.

This guide was built in Obsidian and then exported to HTML; thus it works somewhat similar to a wiki.
It is intended to be read both in a loose order dictated on the sidebar and by skipping around to whatever catches your eye.

### About The Curator
The Dragonheart Collective -also known as Dragon(s)- is a queer nonhuman multiple system.

They have identified as plural since late 2014, and decided to make this guide to coalesce knowledge from across the web on a variety of plural topics that are of concern.

As a system, they generally enjoy collecting information and engaging with fantasy media.
