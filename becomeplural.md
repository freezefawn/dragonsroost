# On Becoming Plural

*“I’m not plural, what if I want to be?”*

That’s fine! There is nothing wrong with this! You are not minimizing a disorder, and you are not appropriating. Plurality is not a medical label and very much includes intentionally created/formed/summoned headmates and has historically done so.

Intentional creation/formation of headmates is something that has been reported in the community for a long time.

**If you want to do so and are FULLY aware of what you are getting into and that it is a long term serious commitment you should give serious thought to, we encourage you to do so.**

We cannot stress this enough, you should be VERY sure before doing things that can inspire plurality. It is a major life decision and many people do not think of the negatives that could come with it.

Some possible negative possibilities;
- This could become permanent if you chose an impermanent option.
- They could become fully separate and autonomous people even if you did not intend that.
- They could dislike you or resent their creation/how you created them/why you created them.
- They could develop in a way that you did not intend.
- You could become disorderly/discover you have a dissociative disorder by aggravating it.

- [Do not create your tulpa on day one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/4mxglc/do_not_create_your_tulpa_on_day_one/)

These warnings apply regardless of the kind of created plurality you are going for.

Put AT LEAST as much thought into this as you might for any major permanent life change.

There are several communities dedicated to creating headmates and each have their own approach to it. The three main ones are <u>Daemonism</u>, <u>Soulbonding</u>, and <u>Tulpamancy</u>.

Give them all a good look before you try them out.

**Daemonism** is a practice surrounding conversing with a mental construct called a daemon based loosely on the *His Dark Materials* series written by Pullman that is used to personify some part of one's conscience as a means to recognize those parts of oneself better. A Daemon is usually depicted and imagined in the shape of an animal to line up with the HDM books.

A daemon has autonomy that ranges from just a well-acted sockpuppet to a fully autonomous and separate entity on the level of any headmate. The philosophy is that everyone has a daemon already as a product of being human, they merely have to learn to listen to it through practice.

Many daemians do not consider themselves plural, or only consider themselves to be resting on the edge just before plurality, as a note.

**Soulbonding** is a practice surrounding 'bonding' to a (usually) fictional entity and having them talk back to you.
Soulbonding originated in a fanfiction writing community, and is thus strongly associated with such. It is a codified subculture surrounding the 'Living Character' phenomenon, which is frequently reported among creatives.

One reaches out to an entity to talk, and may invite the entity back to their headspace (or the entity may come over unannounced).
This often, but not always, has a spiritual lilt to it, though this is not required. Not all soulbonders consider themselves plural for being soulbonders, as not all soulbonders consider their soulbond to live within their mind/body and not all soulbonds are fully autonomous.

Soulbonding is an older community, and people specifically identifying as soulbonders are much less common nowadays with the prevalence of tulpamancy giving a more psychological framework and robust community alongside the concept of walk-ins in the general plural community catching a lot of the rest. However, soulbonders and soulbonding resources may still be found today.

**Tulpamancy** is a (usually) psychological-oriented practice surrounding intentionally inducing plural experiences. A tulpamancer creates an autonomous separate entity called a tulpa and then teaches the tulpa to act autonomously in various ways.

Tulpamancy is by far the biggest created plurality community, and it has the most consistently robust guides on system skill building of any plural community period. They write the lion's share of system guides and the best quality ones on average.

Tulpamancy tends to be much more 'permanant' than the other two as a result of the more deliberate reinforcement of experiences. 
Tulpamancers have a markedly different subculture from the wider plural community, and have different terminology, frameworks, and general culture climate due to how long they have been in isolation.

### What about in general?

If you do not want to join any particular created plurality subculture, you can also just generally create headmates without all the added special frameworks and philosophy.

Generally speaking, all of these communities use the same base technique; just with different twists on it. That being to treat something as already separate until it becomes so.

That something might be a part of yourself that you are sectioning off, or a template or idea of someone that you dreamed up- or you might just talk into the void until something talks back.

One thing that is often critical is that you generally have to believe that it is possible and is already working. Belief does a lot of the work and the frame of mind you are in can be very powerful.

You then proceed to practice at first narrating to, then trying to get short responses from this entity. You can also try 'being' this entity in short bursts. Slowly increasing the intensity and complexity of this until they are as separate as desired. Frequent small sessions are generally preferable to long intense ones, especially at first, as you want to build these skills like muscles. Push gently so as not to tire yourself too much.

It is highly recommended to, even though you are not following any one path, read guides from all of these communities anyway and adapt their techniques, as this can give you a larger pool of things try.

> [!NOTE]
> This is NOT a fast process for most people. Do not expect this to happen overnight!
> Different brains have different thresholds for when a system member forms, as well, so do not judge your progress by other people.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Headpressure** is a sense of pressure or tingling in the head area. This is very common when working on system skills or forming headmates. It is usually considered a promising sign and that your efforts are working. **Headaches** however are a sign you should stop.

## What about an adjacent alternative?

If you want something *like* plurality, but aren't sure of the commitment required, or do not want the cons of permanantly sharing your life with other autonomous people, there are other options!

**Daemonism** on the shallower ends is of course a decent option, but if you want something even more approachable and less likely to cause fully autonomous other people to show up, then there are also other alternatives.

> [!WARNING]
> Having a headmate form is only LESS likely. Its still **fully possible** to acidentally create a headmate by practicing these things if your threshhold for forming headmates is low enough; which can have all the cons stated above. These options may also cause you to develop a maladaptive relationship to daydreaming and fantasy if used inapropriately.

First is the most well known one; **Immersive Daydreaming**. Also known as Neuronarraration or having a parocosm.
Immersive daydreaming is a kind of sequential, intense daydream. The world you imagine in may be called a parocosm. This space may be populated by a wide variety of characters which you imagine in the setting.

There is also **Imagimancy**. Imagimancy is the practice of making imaginary people and interacting with them. For more information, try reading The [Imagimancy Carrd](https://imagimancy.carrd.co/)
