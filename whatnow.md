# So What Now?
So you have determined you are probably-to-definitely plural. Now what?

**The first and most important thing is to not panic.**

Everything is exactly as it was before this moment, but now you know the truth. The only thing new is a word for what you are experiencing.

Its important to slow down, take stock of your situation, and put out any metaphorical fires before you do anything else.

In order of importance:
- **Are you in immediate physical danger?** Do whatever you need to to get out of this FIRST.
- **Are you in immediate life screwage?** (unpaid bills stacking up, legal troubles, failing school, impending job loss, serious interpersonal issues due to system stuff causing conflict, etc). Work on this next and ask for help where possible. Be honest to others that you are having a rough time, even if you do not elaborate on why.
- **Everything else.** Many things can wait until you fix the top two points. Sometimes you have to address system stuff before you can get yourself out of those top two issues, but try to largely focus on those over system stuff. **Your system journey usually can wait until you are not in active crisis.**

Next its important to be aware of the following things:
- It is common to **become more symptomatic when you first become aware**. This is both because you are **finally noticing things** that have been happening all along, and because you and your system are **not unconsciously masking anymore**. Be prepared for this.
- It is ok to be plural. **You are allowed to be plural**. This is not something shameful, or barred to you. If being 'more than one' is your experience, you have claim to the label. You do not need anything else to be here and use resources. Ignore the gatekeepers, they DO NOT speak for the entirety of the community and are by-and-large unhelpful to it.
- It is extremely common to **not know everything** about your system right way, or have you understanding of 'basic facts' about it **change over time**. Do not stress too hard about about your exact origins, headcount, disorder status, and other details- *especially* not this early into your system journey.
- It is ok to **use whatever language and frameworks you want to use** to understand or express your plurality. You do not have to identify with the popular ones used frequently in the community.
- **Doubt is extremely common** for systems. Not only is dissociation that causes memory issues and makes things feel dreamlike or unreal incredibly common, but the world around us denies our experiences and gatekeeping in the community does not help either. You can fight doubt with evidence of your material experiences.
- **Any recovery path is valid**. You do not have to choose to try for a specific one, nor do you have to choose what you want to do right away. Deciding to forgo all guides (including this one!) and doing your own thing included.

Some general ideas of what to do next:
- Establish communication with the others in your system.
- Start a system journal to help organize known information.
- Help the members of your system stabilize and learn to function together.
- Establish ground rules for your system that everyone has to follow.
- Learn and practice system skills like communication, switching at will, co-consciousness, and the building of an inner world of you do not already have one.
- Research community resources to assist in any issues your system may have, learn about plural history, and learn about plural experiences different from yours.
- Contact a therapist if feasible and desired to undergo professional help for your experiences.
- Read more about plurality, and the subsequent community.
- Participate in the community and connect with others like you for advice, belonging, solidarity, and support.


Really, from this point on you can just do whatever you feel like! If you need some direction, we got some pointers, but this master guide of ours is only one of many paths you can take.

Good luck on your plural journey!
