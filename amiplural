# "Am I Plural?"

< This is an updated version of the document released (date here, WIP). It has been split into two sections and has had much of the language updated.

_Well, are you?_

Plurality is being ‘more than one’ in a body. That’s all that’s necessary to consider oneself plural- you just have to consider yourself 'more than one'. If the label gives your experience meaning, use it! If it doesn’t, don’t! Simple as that. Even if you are diagnosed with a dissociative disorder or are having ‘more than one’ experiences, you don’t _have_ to identify as plural if it doesn't spark joy. It is however, nowadays the common-use umbrella for these experiences.

Whether or not one is having a ‘more than one’ experience can sometimes be hard to parse out, so this is a **nonexhaustive** checklist that may help you judge for yourself.
These are not diagnostic criteria, to be clear, you do not need to experience all of the bullet points, or even something from each category to be plural. **Any one ‘more than one’ experience counts as enough to be plural**. These are simply some examples of common experiences we have compiled that may help you conceptualize a experience you may be having as a ‘more than one’ experience that ‘counts’.

Here are a number of other questioning lists, of which inspired this list;

None of them fully suited our purposes of having a checklist to hand others with good examples of common experiences across all of the plurality spectrum, so this was created.

**NOTE:** *We cannot diagnose you with a dissociative disorder*, we are not psychologists, and *no one can tell you if you are plural or not except for you*. Only YOU can decide if you are plural or not.

Experiencing something on this list doesn’t mean you are for-sure plural or have a dissociative disorder, but these are experiences common to those who are or are outright ‘more than one’ experiences in of themselves.

## Some general ‘More Than One’ experiences:
### ‘Hearing voices’ that behave in ‘person-like’ ways, particularly if it’s an ‘internal thought voice’:
- Having ‘your consciousness’ talk to you in extended ways.
- Your internal dialogue is sometimes or always a conversation/dialogue where you only control one side.
- You have ‘parts of yourself’ or ‘other selves’ that you are in conversation with internally, with words or otherwise.
- You have ‘racing thoughts’ where your thought train is many internal dialogues at once.
- Feeling like you have multiple trains of thought going at the same time that have their own consistent perspectives.
- Feeling like you are a ‘collection of voices’, or a ‘collection of separate selves trying to be one person’.
- Having characters (original or otherwise) you write about or think about a lot start talking back or otherwise act autonomously, particularly if they express opinions you did not dictate or can surprise you in their actions.
- Having a ‘spiritual advisor’ comment on things you do.
- Having any other kind of spiritual entity that cohabitates within your body, soul, or mind communicate with you in some way.
- Having an ‘imaginary friend’ long into adulthood that acts autonomously some or all of the time.
- Having recurring vivid dreams involving an entity that seems unusually lucid and consistent
- Otherwise having an internal part of your thoughts that behaves in person-like ways you cannot control, whether is speaks in words or otherwise.

### ‘Identity disturbances’ and having other entities ‘take over’ at any time:
- Feeling like some other entity is moving your body, parts of your body, including controlling your voice.
- Feeling like you are possessed or that you are an outside entity possessing the person who 'should' be in the body some or all of the time.
- Feeling like you simply appeared one day inside of your body one day and are not the same person that was in it before in a very visceral way.
- Feeling whoever you were before has died or 'went away' and left you in their place.
- Not feeling in control of your actions or like you are on autopilot.
- Feeling like you ‘went somewhere else’ for a while and someone else used the body.
- Feeling like you ‘became a different person’ for a while, or otherwise acting and feeling radically differently than usual for certain periods of time, or being told by others that they feel you 'become a different person' sometimes.
- Having a hard time answering or being unable to answer the question ‘Who am I as a person?’ or feeling like 'you' aren't a cohesive person.
 - General feelings that you are ‘not yourself’ sometimes.
- Having some skills or abilities only some of the time, or having your skills get better and worse over time- particularly if this aligns with shifting identity or memory.
- Having general identity labels, opinions, feelings, and preferences change in recurrent ways, especially if more than one thing changes at once.
- Having multiple contrasting thoughts, preferences, or opinions about something at once. (ex- having the impulse preference both that you want a hug and that you would hate to be touched)
- Having your feelings on if the things on this list apply change back and forth, especially if you are oscillating between strong considering and strong denial and this corresponds to other identity changes.
- Having different handwriting, accents, or mannerisms and attribute characteristics to these ‘modes’.
- Feeling like some other entity is influencing your thoughts or feelings some or all of the time.
- Feeling like you have to put effort into being a cohesive person, or that you have to put effort into ‘not being plural’.
- Feeling like you are fundamentally a different person in your dreams to the point you distinguish who you are in your dreams as someone else entirely.
- Otherwise feeling like there are 'others' in your head or body, in general.

### Other General Common Experiences:
- Feeling fascinated with or preoccupied by plurality(media depictions or otherwise) and drawn to it or fantasizing about 'becoming plural' and feeling intense relief because it would 'allow' you to exist freely.
- Feeling fearful and deeply uncomfortable with plurality without knowing entirely why, and getting headaches or forgetful episodes when you think about the concept.
- Repeatedly questioning if you are plural or not, but dismissing it because you feel you do not experience something that others have told you is required beyond being 'more than one' (ex- trauma, switching, early childhood symptoms, amnesia, etc), or because you are not like other systems you have met.
- You have previously been diagnosed with a disorder, but particularly BPD, ADHD, PTSD, selective mutism, a psychotic disorder, or a mood disorder and treatment is not working, not working well, or making things worse.

## Similar Experience Differentials:
- Questioning or thinking you have a specific disorder(such as the ones listed above), that you are an age-regressor, otherkin/therian/fictionkin, or that you have a fluid/fluctuating gender or sexuality, but finding these things do not explain all of your experiences fully.
- Questioning or thinking you have a specific disorder(such as those listed above), but do not fit the usual profile for this disorder or upon speaking with others who have the condition you do not relate to their experiences very much at all.
- Questioning or thinking you are an age-regressor, but your regressed self some or all of the time seems quite different from you in thinking/pronoun preference/names/memory/etc.
- Questioning or thinking you have a fluid/fluctuating orientation or gender, but you experience other details besides your gender or sexual orientation changing at the same time.
- Questioning or thinking you are otherkin/therian/fictionkin because you identify as a nonhuman or fictional entity and seem to experience ‘shifts’, but only identifying that way when you have a ‘shift’.
- Questioning or thinking you are otherkin/therian/fictionkin or are an age-regressor, but your kintype/theriotype/regressed self speaks to you or otherwise takes actions separate from you.
- Other people tell you your experiences with age-regression, gender/sexuality fluidity, or being otherkin/therian/fictionkin are very extreme, or what other people describe feels less massive of a change than what you experience.

## Things that may indicate you have a disorderly presentation of plurality and/or a dissociative disorder:
### Amnesia, general unreliable memory and forgetfulness:
- Remembering only some things some of the time, especially past life events, adverse experience, or personal information of you or others.
- Forgetting about major life changes(such as a change in job or living location) that have happened for notable periods of time before realizing. Especially if it happens more than once, its been years since the change occurred, or it happens at times other than when you have just woken up.
- Forgetting you have forgotten something major, especially if you have to have a revelation about remembering the thing more than once/find evidence that you had to do this.
- Forgetting something rapidly some time after it happened (delayed dissociative amnesia) rather than it happening directly after.
- Feeling like your memory or thoughts have been 'taken' from you as you were thinking them and being unable to recall them after.
- Not remembering certain important or traumatic life events, particularly if they only happened a few years ago.
- Not remembering large swaths of your life- especially your childhood or adolescence, beyond just normal levels of infantile amnesia.
- Not remembering what you did recently, how you got somewhere, or conversations you had- especially if its days at a time.

- Being unable to connect the pieces of your history together, like the conclusion to facts you have slip through your fingers as you try to think them.
- Knowing that something occurred, like a traumatic event, but not knowing what you felt during that time or the exact details of it.
- Feeling like you can’t place life events you have experienced on a timeline very well or at all.
- Feeling like ‘time does not exist’ to you or that you otherwise have a warped perception of time.
- Feeling like it’s the first time you have done something even if you know logically you have done it a million times and have the memory of you doing it many times in the past.

- Feeling like certain memories in the body do not belong to you or otherwise do not feel like yours.
- 'Checking out' of reality during stressful situations in the present, or otherwise having difficulty paying attention during them.

### Dissociation; general disconnects between you, your sense of self, reality, and others around you:
- Feeling 'very strange' in an implacable way some or all of the time.
- Feeling like the world around you is dreamlike, in a fog, surreal, or far way.

- Feeling detached from your thoughts, sense of self, or agency.
- Feeling like your emotions are happening ‘over there’ or to someone else.
- Feeling like you are floating outside your body or watching yourself do things like you are having an out of body experience.
- Having people claim with frequency that you are 'spacey' or 'zoned out' or 'unable to focus'.
- Having difficulty focusing on what is presently going on instead of your own thoughts or internal world is difficult and you feel very ‘zoned out’ often.
- Feeling like your experience of having a body gives about as much of a disconnect as some people seem to have about first-person video games.
- Being very easily being ‘tranced’, hypnotized, or ‘zoned out’ when exposed to stimuli frequently considered hypnotic or rhythmic.

- Experiencing nonepileptic seizures of any kind.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Check with a medical professional to eliminate things such as a gas leak in your house, sleep or food deprivation, heavy metal poisoning, other physical medical issues or drug use if you are experiencing any physical symptom above. It is important to rule out other causes for these, as these other causes of symptoms can be life threatening.

### Other potentially disorderly ‘more than one’ experiences:
- Having number instability in your system, with the active members of your system changing frequently- especially when the system is under stress.
- Having poor communication, control over switching, or memory sharing in the system, with some or all headmates being affected.
- Having a large number of upsetting or negative 'front triggers' for your system, especially if this is the only way for your system to switch with ease or at all. 
- Having headmates that have specific mental health issues you don't seem to have, particularly if they are stuck on a past trauma that you are not or have ptsd or c-ptsd symptoms.
- Having headmates that keep doing or saying things that scare, harm, or otherwise distress you or others in the system.
- Having headmates that lash out at or try to harm the body, others around you, or your possessions.

# “So I might be plural, but I’m not sure yet, how can I be sure?”
Here are some useful things to ask yourself: 
- Have your ‘more than one’ experiences been going on a long time? Have you been experiencing these things before you found the community?
- Does it help you to identify this way? Does the framework help your experiences make sense?
- What happens if you consider the idea you are not plural? Do your speculative headmates object to this? Does internal conflict intensify? Do you function worse?
- What do the others in your head think is going on? Do they have opinions about this?

Answering yes or no isn't a perfect accuracy test, but if you answer yes a lot, its a strong nod in the plural direction.

Its also worth asking if another framework regarding your identity fits you better. There are a number of neurodivergencies and non-normative identity experiences that present in ways that are superficially similar to plurality. You may find these experiences are closer to your own.

Check the differentials section below (skip) for some examples of non-normative identity experiences and how they differ from plurality.


## “I’m still not sure, how can I get evidence the headmates are really there?”
- **First, ONLY proceed if you actually WANT to be plural.** Doing this sort of questioning , focusing, and talking to the void can push you over the edge into plurality when you would not otherwise have been. If you are not sure and do not want to be, then this can wait.
- Keep a journal and log your experiences in this vein, such as identity changes at different points in the day, known memory trouble, any voice hearing, and other experiences.
- For a bit treat yourself as really plural, give names to your ‘alternate states’ or ‘voices’ and start treating them like other people. Does it make things better? Do they communicate back? Does how you exist make more sense by doing this? You have your answer.
- Leave physical notes(such as in your phone, in a journal, or sticky notes in your belongings) and see if you get responses that can’t be from another external person back.
- Try to communicate or otherwise talk to the possible headmates internally, if you get consistent personlike responses then they are there. Again- be aware treating something like it is there often enough will make it real and is how intentionally created headmates are made.
- If you are experiencing distressing or debilitating symptoms try to visit a therapist licensed in dissociation and they may be able to help you determine if you have a dissociative disorder.

# Differential Experiences:
Sometimes its hard to distinguish plurality from other similar experiences, so this part of the guide is for that.

It is also worth noting that one may have both something on this list going on AND be plural at the same time.

**Defining otherkin/therian/fictionkin** - Identifying in part or in whole as a nonhuman entity/nonhuman animal/fictional character on an integral level.

## Nonhuman or fictional identifying headmate vs being otherkin/therian/fictionkin/etc:
- A kintype does not have an identity, opinions, or preferences separate from you- a kintype IS you. Shifting should not very drastically change these things either.
- A kintype cannot talk to you or act autonomously separate from you, the kintype IS you.
- A kintype does not recurrently 'take over' your body and prevent you from being in control of your actions.
- A kintype does not cause memory trouble when you are shifted.
- A kintype is with you in part all of the time, you are not 100% that thing then 0% that thing.
- If the shifts of a kintype happen only when you hit a trauma or dissociation trigger and are extremely strong, it may instead be a headmate.

**Defining age regression** - A genuine cognition change that one interprets as 'regressing' to a younger age. The cognition change can manifest as impairments in things such as impulse control, cognitive reasoning, and ability to comfortably complete 'adult' tasks. The cognition change may also manifest in just generally 'feeling very young'. Age regression is heavily tied to coping with trauma as has been since its modern codifying as a subculture, but trauma is NOT required to experience it.

## Age regression vs having a headmate who is younger than the body:
- An age regressed state does not have an identity, opinions, or preferences separate from you- it IS you, just in an altered state. Being regressed should not drastically change these things either.
- An age regressed state cannot talk to you or act autonomously separate from you- it IS you, just you in an altered state.
- An age regressed state does not cause memory trouble when you are regressed.
- If the age regressed state happens very uncontrollably and/or only when you hit a trauma or dissociation trigger, it may instead be a headmate.

## Having a fluid/fluctuating gender/orientation vs having headmates with different genders/orientations:
- A fluid/fluctuating gender/orientation does not have an identity, opinions, or preferences exclusively attached to each gender feeling.
- A fluid/fluctuating gender/orientation does not cause your other gender/orientation identities to feel like separate people when you are not currently those gender/orientations.
- A gender/orientation cannot talk to you or act autonomously- it is you just in a different state.
- A fluid/fluctuating gender/orientation should not cause memory trouble between different labels.
- If your gender/orientation only changes when you hit a trauma or dissociation trigger, it may instead be a headmate

## Having an imaginary friend vs having a headmate:
- An imaginary friend cannot reliably take autonomous actions or speak without you puppeting them.
- An imaginary friend cannot surprise or disagree with you- it is a puppet and you control it.
- An imaginary friend cannot refuse to do something that you try to make them do, they are a puppet you control.
- An imaginary friend cannot 'take over' your body or prevent you from being in control of your actions.
- An imaginary friend cannot 'take' or 'hide' memories from you.
- An imaginary friend does not suddenly exist without you making them, they are a created puppet of yours.

## Having a rich parocosm/daydream world vs having an inner world with a lot of headmates inside:
- A parocosm is something you create and control entirely. There are generally not elements of it that can surprise you or that you did not consciously add.
- The inhabitants of a parocosm including the character(s) that represent you cannot take autonomous actions or think their own thoughts without you puppeting them.
- The inhabitants of a parocosm including the character(s) that represent you cannot 'take over' your body.
- The inhabitants of a parocosm including the character(s) that represent you cannot take or hide memories from you.

## Interacting with fully outside spiritual entities vs having walk-ins or soulbonds:
- A fully outside spiritual entity does not generally spend notable amounts of time inhabiting your mindscape or otherwise mentally communicating with you, they are external and not fully connected all of the time.
- An outside spiritual entity does not generally spend notable amounts of time using your body outside of non-ritual practice. They live outside the body more than not.
- An outside spiritual entity does not generally uncontrollably end up possessing the body against both your and/or their will, especially if external triggers are involved.

**NOTE:** The outside spiritual entity to headmate line is historically blurry due to many of the material experiences being essentially the same (internal communication, fronting, passive influence, possible memory issues, etc) in some cases. Its really up to the individual spirit-host partnership to decide if they wish to consider themselves plural when their experiences in practice are essentially the same or not.
